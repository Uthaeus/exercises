# Heap

# The standard and most common way for Ruby to save string data is in the 'heap'.

# The heap is a core concept of the C language

# # Pointers

# In computer science, a pointer is a programming language object whose value refers to (or 'points to') another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its memory address.

# A pointer references a location in memory and obtaining the value stored at that lodcation is known as dereferencing the pointer.

# As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding 

# C programmers can allocate from and use via a call to the malloc function. For example, this line of C code allocates a 100 byte chunk of memory from the heap and saves its memory address into a pointer:

#     char *ptr = malloc(100);

# Later, when the c programmer is done with this memory, she can release it and return it to the system using free:

#     free(ptr);


# Ruby String Creation

# Avoiding the need to manage memory in this very manual and explicit way is one of the biggest benefits of using any high level programming language such as Ruby, Java, C#, etc.
